**Today's Progress**: I was able to merge a repo from a local copy called "Master" into the github remorte copy "main".  

**Thoughts:** It took me several tries to get it to merge but what I realized was that I need to follow these steps...
```
//Make sure master is up to date. 
git checkout master
git pull origin master

//switch to the "main" branch
git checkout main

//Merge changes from "master" into "main"
git merge master
```

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
