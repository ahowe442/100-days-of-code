# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### R1D1 
#### Day 0: March 9, 2024 
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: I was able to merge a repo from a local copy called "Master" into the github remorte copy "main".  

**Thoughts:** It took me several tries to get it to merge but what I realized was that I need to follow these steps...
```
//Make sure master is up to date. 
git checkout master
git pull origin master

//switch to the "main" branch
git checkout main

//Merge changes from "master" into "main"
git merge master
```
