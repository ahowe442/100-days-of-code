# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D4

#### Day 5: March 12, 2024

<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: I was able to rebase a repo from the github remote into my local copy that was not up to date.

**Thoughts:** I used ChatGpt to help me with the correct git commmands. That made it really quick and easy to complete a task that I was nervous to attempt. I was afraid that I was going to mess up the work that I had already completed or make a duplicate copy that I would have to delete the old one. I tried merging first but that didn't work becasue it said that there were errors. I knew the remote version was the way I wanted the file to look and I wanted to start from there. I suppose there might be times when that is not the best action, especially when I'm not working solo. Anyhow, here's the code: Rebase:
If you prefer to rebase your changes on top of the latest commits from the remote branch, you can run:

```
git rebase origin/main
```

// This command reapplies your local commits on top of the latest commits from the remote main branch.

#### Day 2: March 11, 2024

<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: I played around with CSS and made a menu for a coffee shop.

**Thoughts:** What I learned or remembered was that selectors can select elements like

- id selectors (#my-id, selects `<p id="my-id"></p>`)
- class selector (.my-class, selects `<p class="my-class">`)
- Attribute selector (img[src], selects `<img src="myimage.png">`)
- Pseudo-class selector (a:hover, selects `<a>`, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link.)

### R1D2

#### Day 1: March 10, 2024

<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: I watched a Udemy Javascript Course
**Thoughts:** I was able to get a refresher on Javascript variables, and data-types.
I practiced typing out js code and html. I remembered how to link in the head tag the script tag with the src of the script.js.

### R1D1

#### Day 0: March 9, 2024

<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: I was able to merge a repo from a local copy called "Master" into the github remorte copy "main".

**Thoughts:** It took me several tries to get it to merge but what I realized was that I need to follow these steps...

Make sure master is up to date.

```
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```

switch to the "main" branch

```
git checkout main
```

Merge changes from "master" into "main"

```
git merge master
```
